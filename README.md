# projects:

   Snake Game: Experience the thrill of a classic snake game built entirely in Python using the Pygame library.
   Navigate a growing snake through a maze of fruit, where each consumption increases its length.
   But beware: touching the boundaries or the snake itself ends the game. Test your reflexes as the challenge escalates with every fruit eaten.
   Enjoy seamless interaction through a colorful Graphical User Interface (GUI) for an immersive gaming experience.

 # Get in Touch:
     I'm always open to collaboration and learning opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me via email or connect with me on LinkedIn!
